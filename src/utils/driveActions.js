/**
 * Upload loose files, or a picked/dropped folder, under `parentID`.
 *
 * Folders of the same name merge. For files:
 *
 * - one still unfinished in the target folder under the same name and size
 *   (a closed tab, a failure) is uploaded into its old record, from the
 *   parts Telegram already has when the bytes are unchanged. Nothing is
 *   asked: it is the same upload, interrupted.
 * - one whose name is taken by a finished file is a conflict, as when
 *   copying in a file manager. `onConflict(conflicts)` decides for all of
 *   them at once and resolves to "replace" (the old file goes to the trash
 *   once the new one is up), "keep" (the new one is renamed "name (1).ext"),
 *   "skip", or "cancel", which uploads nothing at all. Without it they are
 *   skipped.
 * - one with no such name here, but a finished file of the same name and
 *   size in another folder, is likely already on Telegram.
 *   `onElsewhere(found)` decides for all of them: "link" adds a record
 *   sharing that file's message (linkFile) instead of uploading it again,
 *   "upload" sends it anyway, "cancel" uploads nothing. Without it they are
 *   uploaded. A linked file's original is never deleted: its bytes were
 *   never read, so nothing shows they are the ones Telegram has.
 * - one bigger than Telegram takes (uploadLimit) is not uploaded and counts
 *   as skipped. `onTooBig(files, limit)` is told, without being waited for,
 *   so the rest of the upload carries on. Each file comes with its
 *   `parentID` and `asMedia`, for sending the pieces it is cut into.
 *
 * Resolves to how many files were `queued`, `resumed`, `replaced`,
 * `renamed`, `linked` and `skipped`.
